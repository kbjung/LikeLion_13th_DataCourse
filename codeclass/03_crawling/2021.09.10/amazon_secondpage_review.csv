review
"Computer is easy to work with.  Setup was a breeze.  But, any new computer takes time to adjust your settings, learn new ways to work with it and add the programs and apps that you want.  It's good looking and very responsive.  The corded keyboard and mouse were vey lightweight and I replaced them with some better quality wireless ones.  I would buy again."
"After much research, I bought this computer for my partner, as she was getting frustrated with her 3-year old one. This one is a keeper.Is it  the fastest machine in the world ... no; but on the other hand, it is not the slowest either. In fact, its speed is more than adequate. Is it a good ""gaming"" computer? Absolutely not! The graphics are ""par excellence,"" and the sound from the front loaded speakers is much better than I expected. However, for $500 including 8 gigs of ram and a 256 gb SSD , I do not think that the value can be beat.  It is very well constructed and solid, except for the DVD read/write drive. You must be gentle with it, but it works fine. We also appreciate the hidden, private, and covered camera and built-in microphone which becomes observable and usable only when you want to use it. We always had to put a covering over the camera and over the microphone port in all the other machines in our house hold including the smart TV's."
"Easy to set up. A lady's voice walks you through the whole set up process. Clear vivid picture, fast moving through different applications, windows 10 working fine, comes with word, excel and many other significant programs that are perfect for me. The CDROM made my printer set up a breeze and easy set up instructions like where all of the plugs go into where. Even easy for ME! Very pleased and would highly recommend especially if you need the CD because new models coming out don't have the CD. You would have to buy a separate CD unit (only about $40.00) but why have to. Again GREAT Computer!"
"Very easy to set up as there were no wires to the printer, and to the screen, etc.  Everything hooked right up and talked to each other.  I did purchase an extra USB setup as I have many small items that only charge from a USB cord with no option for plugging in to an outlet.  I would have loved a second screen but it does not have the ability to add a traditional plug in one, so I will have to wait and buy a wireless one down the road.  Good speed.  Hate all of the HP and Microsoft ""you need this"" because I like to keep my PC simple, but for the mean time I have let them have their way to monitor me to the end of the earth.  I got this particular set up for the cost, and the fact that I really do not do ""a lot"" on my PC, no gaming etc. I can't stand laptops and I run an Etsy business so this is perfecto! With Windows 11 on the horizon my other PC was not compatible to it anyways.  And if forced me to update items I had purchased long ago so my graphics programs, etc., are all in 2021 now - to the future - and beyond!"
"HP customer service is the worst! I bought this item, and, within the first 5 weeks, it went black on the screen. I had to travel 60 miles round trip to mail it back to them, in the carton, HP provided. It was over a 2 week wait to have it returned to me. It only stayed fixed for a few more weeks. Now I can't get the right department, to return it to them, once again. The screen goes black intermittently, sporadically. I give up. I love the large screen, but, other than that, I think it's a waste of money. I DO NOT recommend this to anyone. I am HUGELY disappointed, and I juts hope the screen stays on. ARRGGH!"
"The screen doesn't glare as much as others, easier on the eyes. Of course, the negatives are that Microsoft tries to overwhelm you with their products and add ons, most of which you don't need anyway. The tilt screen is really nice. It's thin and lightweight. It's kinda weird that they put the model and serial numbers where you can't reach them unless you turn the screen upside down. I do like it, but it's taking me an inordinate amount of time to get all my ""stuff"" on there. The worst thing is they give you a keyboard and mouse with cables instead of cordless! Ug."
"Pro: The computer is an upgrade from our 10 year old system.  Love the large screen, microphone and camera work well for online classes and meetings. Keyboard works well.Con: System runs a little slow.  The mouse is a struggle and will need to be replaced. I have to click on the mouse numerous times to get it to respond."
"This HP All in-one model is an awesome value at a surprisingly low price point if two things are acceptable: no touchscreen and the 8 GB main memory is shared with Graphics (so only 6 GB effective for programs).  For my desk/office use, I only use mouse/keyboard so no issue for me.  Boot-up/setup was easy and flawless, the performance boost from the 256 GB SSD drive is huge (if you are used to a ""hard"" disk drive), graphics are clear, and including a writable DVD drive is a nice plus.  You ""pop up"" the webcam when needed, although the HP webcam quality is not the best.  This system is TOTALLY quiet.  Great choice."
"This replaced a cheapo Dell AIO I had been using as a bedside browser and streaming video player. The Dell was a single core CPU with the world's slowest hard drive - really, it would take 20 minutes to do a reboot and heaven help me if Microsloth decided to update Windows 10.The HP won't win any prizes as a gaming PC, but it isn't meant to be one. With two physical cores and whatever AMD calls hyperthreading, the CPU is more than adequate for browsing and video watching. The SSD is a screamer compared to my old hard drive. I also like the fact the webcam is on a manually operated pop-up - I never liked the thought that someone could hack my system and use the camera without my knowledge.The two negatives are the amount of bloatware the system came with, which HP keeps re-installing when I uninstall them. The second is the lack of any information on updating the memory with a second SODIMM. The online manual from HP is a joke as far as hardware is concerned and searching the Internet resulted in zero hardware maintenance docs or articles on disassembly. Even looking up the model number on Crucial or a few other memory retailers came back with no matches. If I hadn't found a mention of a motherboard model # I wouldn't even have known there is supposed to be a second SODIMM slot.Oh, yeah, I just saw the 'Rate features'  of this review. I don't use the touch screen function, so I can't say how well that works. I would rate the value of the units as average, although the mouse and keyboard are super-cheap. I threw out the keyboard and replaced with an old mechanical keyboard I had laying around.One final complaint: for a relatively new system, why doesn't it have a USB type-C port? Most modern USB peripherals require a type-C port and it irritates me that HP left one off."
"I have not found anything I do not like about this computer. It has a huge clear screen, it's fast, camera and speakers are top notch. Easy set up...love it!"
